In files with water depth, pressure compensation is applied from 10246300, with following options:
-Hold constant first recorded pressure if compensation pressure series started later than water pressure series
-Calculate density based on temperature, assuming fresh water
-Apply pressure compensation based on sensor

Elevations should be verified.
