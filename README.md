# Data-Logger-Processing
Repository code to process water level data loggers at Lions Bay. 

Altitude correction must be applied to compensate for difference in elevation between barometric pressure gauge and water level logger.

Other things to add to the code:
* highlight or isolate diurnal cycle (e.g. by making plot with one trace for each day, all starting at same y-coordinate point at midnight)
* loading intake activity in notebook for joint analysis.
